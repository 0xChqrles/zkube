# Business Model

The primary business model for zKube revolves around the tournament feature.

### Tournament Entry Fees

- Players pay a small fee to enter tournaments.
- A percentage of the entry fees will be taken as revenue, with the remaining amount distributed as prizes to the winners.

### In-Game Purchases

- If tournament revenue is insufficient, consider offering in-game purchases.
- Players can buy bonuses to enhance their gameplay experience in addition of winning them freely (but limited).
